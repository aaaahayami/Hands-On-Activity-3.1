Install Ubuntu and CentOS in your virtual machine.
Create a github repository and modify the collaborative, then add your groupmates username.
Clone the github inside the Ubuntu terminal.
Create ansible roles by typing the command "ansible-galaxy init "
Create the tree for each role by typing the command "tree "
Install the web services on their corresponding role by modifying "main.yml" on each role.
Create playbook that runs all the roles you have installed with different web services.
Run the playbook by typing the command "ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass "
Add, commit, and push the roles to github repository.
